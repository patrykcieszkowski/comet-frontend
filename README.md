# Installation [^](#installation-)
  ```js
    $ git clone https://github.com/patrykcieszkowski/comet-frontend.git
    $ npm install // install dependencies
  ```
  Once you do so, remember to config the webpack, before your start building an app. You should set your CDN url (public path), as well as URLs to the backend part of the app (API and Socket.IO), which you can find [HERE](https://github.com/patrykcieszkowski/comet-backend). After you got this done, you can start compiling:

  ```js
    $ npm run build
  ```

  Alternatively, you might want to modify the code. Don't hesitate to do so, it's a MIT licensed app, you can do with it whatever you want. :) Then you might want to start the dev server:

  ```js
    $ npm start
  ```

  And do your magic! Webpack has already set hot reloader, so you don't have to worry about it.
